        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup finely diced yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups cold milk</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry egg noodles</li>
            <li>2 (5.5 ounce) cans tuna packed in olive oil, drained and crumbled, or to taste</li>
            <li>¾ cup frozen peas, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt until it starts to soften up and turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the flour, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, reducing heat if needed.</li>
            <li>Pour in cold milk and whisk for 1 minute. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens and comes to a simmer. Remove from heat, whisk in Cheddar cheese, and reserve until needed.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water and remaining salt and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles for 5 minutes. Drain well and add to a large mixing bowl. Stir in the reserved sauce, followed by tuna, peas, cayenne, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix with a spatula until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared dish. Mix bread crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and olive oil together in a small bowl until combined and resembling wet sand. Sprinkle evenly over the casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
